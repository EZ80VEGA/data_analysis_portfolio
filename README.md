# Ezequiel Vega - Data Analysis Portfolio

## About

Hello! I am Ezequiel, a Management and International Business Undergrad from CSU Monterey Bay. After not having a clear career path I was given the opportunity to build and present reports as an analyst for an upcoming electric motorcycle company in the Central Coast of California.
Now that I got my feet wet into working with data I set out to build my roots down this data analytics path. 

Here you will find my beginner portfolio which I will update as I go.

Thanks for checking it out!

## Power BI

### Sales Dashboard

**Issue:** A local company inquired about creating a dashboard that lets them view and compare sales using their last three years of sales data. The requirements were to build an interactive dashboard using the year, city, product and channel of sale. 

**Solution:** Create a dashboard which includes slicers for the year, city, product & channel. Based on the selection they will be able to view their sales, profit, profit margin and the number of products they have sold. While being able to see the differences in changes for the type of products they have sold and the month. Knowing which locations their top custmers are located will help them prioritize advertising. It is important as well to know which customers they may be having sales issues with and the channel of the sale between Wholesale, Distribut or or Export. 

**Topics:**
- Custom Columns
- Date Table using DAX
- Table Relationship Management
- Slicer
- Independent Measure Table
- Tool Tip
