# Ezequiel Vega - Data Analysis Portfolio

## About

Hello! I am Ezequiel, a Management and International Business Undergrad from CSU Monterey Bay. After not having a clear career path I was given the opportunity to build and present reports as an analyst for an upcoming electric motorcycle company in the Central Coast of California.
Now that I got my feet wet into working with data I set out to build my roots down this data analytics path. 

Here you will find my beginner portfolio which I will update as I go.

Thanks for checking it out!

## Projects
In order to exemplify what I have learned, I try to apply those newly learned skills.



## CSS & HTML

### Personal Website

**Issue:** I already owned a domain but never put it to use. I tried using WordPress to build my website but I could not find any website templates I liked.

**Topics:**
- HREF Links
- Buttons
- Keyframes
- NavBar
- Form

## Power BI

### Sales Dashboard

**Issue:** A local company reached out inquiring about the possibility of creating a dashboard that lets them view and compare sales using their last three years of sales data. They wanted this dashboard to be interactive and allowing them to choose the viewing of data based on the year, city, product and channel of sale. 

**Solution:** Create a dashboard which includes the selection of the year, city, product & channel. Based on the selection they will be able to view their sales, profit, profit margin and the number of products they have sold. While being able to see the differences in changes for the type of products they have sold and the month. Knowing which locations their top custmers are located will help them prioritize advertising. It is important as well to know which customers they may be having sales issues with and the channel of the sale between Wholesale, Distribut or or Export. 

**Topics:**
- Custom Columns
- Date Table using DAX
- Table Relationship Management
- Slicer
- Independent Measure Table
- Tool Tip

### Web Scraping - Top 100 Companies

**Issue:** I want to use a table from an internet webpage to do some analysis, but I can't just download the data.
