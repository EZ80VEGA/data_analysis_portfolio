# Ezequiel Vega - Data Analysis Portfolio

## About

Hello! I am Ezequiel, a Management and International Business Undergrad from CSU Monterey Bay. After not having a clear career path I was given the opportunity to build and present reports as an analyst for an upcoming electric motorcycle company in the Central Coast of California.
Now that I got my feet wet into working with data I set out to build my roots down this data analytics path. 

Here you will find my begginer portfolio which I will update as I go.

Thanks for checking it out!

## Portfolio Projects
In order to exemplify what I have learned here I try to apply those newly learned skills.

### Instagram Clone Challenge

This was the main project for 'The Ultimate MySQL Bootcamp' where we try and replicate the basics for an Instagram like app. All the skills learned within the course were practiced here. From creating a database to creating and referencing tables as well as creating individual lines of code to answer a specific question.
