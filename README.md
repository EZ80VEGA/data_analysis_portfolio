# Ezequiel Vega - Data Analysis Portfolio

## About

Hello! I am Ezequiel, a Management and International Business Undergrad from CSU Monterey Bay. After not having a clear career path I was given the opportunity to build and present reports as an analyst for an upcoming electric motorcycle company in the Central Coast of California.
Now that I got me feet wet into working with data I set out to build my roots down this data analytics path. 

Here you will find my begginer portfolio which I will update as I go.

Thanks for checking it out!
